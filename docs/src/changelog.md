InvoiceGuard follows semver. Newest first.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-02

First release on PyPI (`pip install invoiceguard`) and GitHub.

### Added

- CLI: `init`, `client add/list`, `project create/list/ack`, `invoice create/list/mark-paid/void`, `check-due`, `dashboard`
- Stripe deposit payment links per project (test-mode friendly), with `invoiceguard_invoice_id` metadata so webhook payments map back to invoices
- Late-fee contract generator: deposit + late-fee clause markdown, client acknowledgment recorded when the deposit link is accepted
- Automated 3-stage dunning: day-1 polite nudge → day-7 firm reminder → day-15 formal notice quoting the late-fee clause; idempotent, cron-friendly (`check-due`), editable markdown templates
- Localhost web dashboard: invoice list with status filters and escalation stages, per-invoice detail with chronological timeline, totals/outstanding/overdue/collected, Stripe webhook receiver that marks invoices paid
- SQLite persistence (shared schema between CLI and dashboard), Docker Compose setup

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Stripe webhook secret resolution.** The README told users to set `stripe_webhook_secret` in the config (or `INVOICEGUARD_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`), but the dashboard only honored the bare `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var — webhooks returned 500 for anyone following the docs. The endpoint now resolves, in order: `INVOICEGUARD_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env → `stripe_webhook_secret` in the config file → legacy `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env (still supported). Placeholder values (`whsec_...`) count as unconfigured. Regression tests cover all four cases.

### Honest scope (v1)

- The "signature" is a client-acknowledgment checkbox (deposit-link acceptance), not a legal e-signature — real e-signature is on the roadmap.
- Email deliverability is the user's own SMTP; late-fee enforceability varies by jurisdiction.
